  - `core/`: This directory typically contains code that's shared across the app, like utilities and constants.
  - `data/`: This directory typically contains code related to data, like models and data providers.
  - `presentation/`: This directory typically contains code related to the user interface, like widgets and screens.
  - `main.dart`: This is the entry point of the Flutter application.
